I'm a Data Scientist at a small data mining consulting company in DC called [Elder Research].  I turn data into numbers, numbers into words, 
words into stories and stories into action for my clients.  

I'm interested in a wide range of things from machine learning to international issues to diy woodworking to long-distance running.  My aim is to write
about interesting things throughout this spectrum in a pseudo organized fashion.
