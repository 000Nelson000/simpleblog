This may sound blasphemous coming from a data scientist.  It's really more of a open question than a criticism.
Is data science becoming too institutionalized?  Specifically in universities?

Does the establishment of newly created curriculums and academic degrees focused soley on data science threaten to take some of the swag out of it?  Will these programs homogenize a field that has been made rich by the cross pollination of experts from a wide range of disciplines?  Data Science is such a vast and interdisciplinary field; can comprehensive data science university programs produce both experts and generalists?  So much of data science is learned through experimenting in the field; how effective is it to teach data science in a classroom?

I don't have answers to these questions, but they're questions I've thought about.

## Data science is blowing up  

##### LinkedIn Hottest Skills

This is no secret to anyone remotely involved in the data science world.  LinkedIn ranks *Statistical Analysis and Data Mining*
as the [#1 skill that got people hired in 2014 in nearly every country]. [^1].

##### Search terms

Since people started Googling "data science" and "data scientist" in 2011, the rise has been exponential.

##### Hype Cycle

Whether the momentum behind the data science movement is sustainable is another question.  Gartner sticks data science directly into the Peak of Inflated Expectations phase on their [hype cycle for emerging technologies].

## Danger 1: Homogenous

Part of what I love about data science is that no two data scientists have taken the same path.  Nearly everyone, no matter their experience level, will have some skill or unique mindset from their background that no other data scientist on a team has.  Contrast with many other fields where the cumulative knowledge gained 


I'm constantly amazed by the diversity in backgrouds among data scientists.  

In my previous life as an aspiring eonomist, there was a single one-way road, a PhD in economics.   

Jerry Friedman mentions around 5:00 how researchers often make large contributions when they swith fields and bring a fresh outside-of-the-box persepctive.
