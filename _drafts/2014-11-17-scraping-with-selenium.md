### If you've ever...

felt like you're playing Simon Says with mouse clicks when repeatedly extracting data from a
front-end interface to a database on the web in chunks, well, you probably are.
There's probably a better solution.  You can probably use [Selenium].

ever used XML or httr in R or urllib2 in Python, you've probably encountered the situation where 
the source code you've scraped for a website doesn't contain all the information you desire and see in your browser.

### How it all works
Selenium is a web automation tool.
While not developed specifically for web scraping, Selenium does it pretty dang well.
