Next to add: 

* make app work on default view
* add a vertical line to the histogram, or highlight the bar or something to indicate where the current selection is
* add hourly window slider at the bottom that allows to see what 5 minutes looks like at midday vs rush hour
* add text to app that says:
    On average: 5 minutes really means 6.5 minutes
    On a late days*: 5 minutes could mean 12 minutes or more
    On an early day*: 5 minutes could mean 4 minutes

    * late days are the latest 10%      of predictions
    * early dats are the earliest 10% of predictions

* add error scatter chart
* add scroll scatter plot (maybe)
