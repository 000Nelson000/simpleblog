After attempting some low-light shots with the newly purchased DSLR camera, I quickly realized
it was seemingly impossible to get any non-blurry photographs.  Any attempt at an exposure with 
shutter speed slower than 1/30 s just didn't work. I couldn't keep the camera steady enough
with my hands--cycling through the hills of Rock Creek Park with a backpack filled with 
gear and getting short of breath certainly didn't help.

So I bought a portable [Slik tripod](http://www.adorama.com/SLSP2BGM.html) 
and brought it on my bike/photo
venture into Rock Creek Park on a Wednesday afternoon.  I spotted some deer walking in the river which
looked photo-worthy, so I ripped out the tripod and camera.  By the time I pulled out 
all the gear and I figured out how to use the tripod, the skittish deer were long gone.

However, I did see this [Barred Owl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barred_owl), which 
I chased around the park for a solid hour -- not incredibly hard to follow as they
make a rather identifiable screeching sound.
