It's a question I get asked relatively frequently:

>What is a data scientist?

I often invent a slightly different answer time each time, often falling short of conveying a good answer.

The best definition I've come across is:

>Data Scientist, (n.): Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.
[- Josh Wills](https://twitter.com/josh_wills/status/198093512149958656)

It's easy to forget that this is true, even for yourself (or at least myself).  When I find myself talking with seasoned software engineers, my programming chops that feel impressive
relative to other analysts quickly start to feel middling at best.  Likewise, discussing some theoretical mathematics 

I suppose the best data scientists are better at software engineering than any software engineer AND better at statistics than any statistician.  Well that would be nice.
But is that possible?  This reminds me of comparative advantage and David Ricardo.

#### Data Scientists vs (Statisticians, Economists, Researchers):

*   Data Scientists use version control
*   Data Scientists know a little about a lot
*   ... but have the capability to learn a lot about a little when required
*   ... and know how to figure out when it's necessary.
*   Data Scientists trust algorithms first, data second, subject matter experts third, children fourth, economists fifth (just kidding...)
*   Economists and Statisticians seem to love hedging their findings by talking about assumptions
*   Statisticians and Economists use theoretical and parametric methods to construct errors and confidence intervals.
*   Data Scientists run bootstrapped simulations to calculate confidence intervalss.
