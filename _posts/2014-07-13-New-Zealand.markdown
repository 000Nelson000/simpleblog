# Itinerary
June 20 - July 8 (2014)

##### Day 1: DC - Auckland

We arrived in Auckland at 8am Sunday morning from DC via LAX (interesting).  Even the airport in LA feels like urban sprawl... 
we ended up leaving what felt like the airport to run across some busy 4-lane roads to catch our international connection.
We were greeted with our names paging throughout the terminal and the kiwi equivalent of the secret service.  Apparently the 
[Prime Minister of New Zealand was on our flight](http://newzealand.usembassy.gov/obamakey14.html).

Beyond circumnavigating the city by foot, gawking at the [Sky Tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Tower_(Auckland)), 
checking out Devonport on the ferry, we had a pretty low key-day and crashed promptly at dark... which is 5pm in New Zealand winter.

##### Day 2: Auckland - Waitomo
Black water rafting at Waitomo Caves - definitely worth it! The coolest thing we did on the north island.  

Black water rafting = cave + underground river + tubing

Basically you show up to this small one road town of Waitomo.  The cave folk get you done up in a wetsuit with a head lamp and inner tube, 
drive you over to a random spot on the side of the road and guide you down a short trail to a river flowing into a hole in the ground (hello cave).
Parts of the cave river are slow enough for lazy river tubing and glo worm gazing.  Some sections are fast enough to get the heart pumping, 
Some sections are small waterfalls with one way down (jumping).  

Beyond the awesomeness of tubing through a cave river, the style of the whole outfit struck me.  For a tourist attraction, it felt pretty real.
No signs, no manufactured walkways or handrails, no lights inside, nothing unnatural.  Just a cave and a river.  A different style from the caves
I've seen in the States [Ruby Falls](http://www.rubyfalls.com/) in Tennessee and the caverns in Virginia.

No photos, because, well, we were in a cave with a lots of water and lots of dark. However [Black Water Rafting Co](http://www.waitomo.com/black-water-rafting.aspx) has a cool video.

##### Day 3: Waitomo - Rotorua

Rotorua: the land of hot springs, mud pools, geysers and that sulphur smell (it stinks).

The town itself was pretty normal.  The geothermal park was the big thing around, so we checked it out.  Cool for a day - pleasant walk, lots of photos.

Afterward we found Kerosene Creek - a waterfall flowing through a hot spring off a dirt road.  Off the beaten path, but definitely worth it - 
much warmer than cave water!
